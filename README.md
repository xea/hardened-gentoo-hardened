# hardened-gentoo-hardened

## Description

hardened-gentoo-hardened is an attempt to formalise the creation of a reasonably secure Gentoo Linux installation, extending beyond the normal (hardened) Gentoo Linux setup, including some degree of containerisation and application isolation. 

## Goals

The main goal of this document is to organise my attempts to create a reasonably secure Linux installation in a readable format. 

## Non-goals

Creating a comprehensive tutorial covering all aspects of security is definitely not a goal. Attaining certifiable or military-grade security is also not a goal and everything documented here should be taken with care.

## Main principles

### Isolation: services running on the server should be exposed as little as possible.

### Mandatory constraints

### Performance

## Service installations

### Email (SMTP)

### Email (IMAP)

### PostgreSQL

### DNS

### Logging

### VPN

### Proxying

## Why?
